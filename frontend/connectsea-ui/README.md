# ConnectSea UI (Frontend)

Minimal Angular skeleton. To run:

1. Install Angular CLI if needed: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. From this folder run:
   `npm install`
   `npm start`

Copy `src` into an Angular project if you prefer creating one with `ng new`.
The frontend expects the backend API at `/api` (you can use a proxy or run both locally).
